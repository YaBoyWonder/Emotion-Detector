# Emotion Detector

Using the Watson NLP Library, this program will allow you to input a string of what you're feeling (your emotion), 
which will then calculate the emotion values for:
- anger
- disgust
- fear
- joy
- sadness

The output will also include the most dominant emotion detected amongst each other in the list.
